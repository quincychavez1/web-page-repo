<h2>About Us</H2>

<P> A contract manufacturing (CM) company that manufactures electoric circuit boards for large OEMs (Original Equiment Manufacturers). The OEMs design the hardware and circuits, manufacturing assemby techniques which include automated assembly lines where machines place the parts on the pre-printed circuit boards, send them through ovens where the parts are soldered to the boards, and wash the boards after they are soldered. Failures are tracked and brough to an in-house Failure Analysis lab to determine why teh parts are failing and to determine wehre in the process problems might be occuring.
